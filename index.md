# Deep Learning Notes

## Mathematics for Deep Learning

[My Mathematics for Deep Learning](./mma-notes/MathematicsForDeepLearning.nb.pdf) notes are intended to document &mdash; with easy-to-follow but rigorous steps &mdash; the multi-variable calculus commonly used in back-propagation. The final answer is shockingly simple. However, the apparent simplicity depends on some sweet notation.

#### I should probably add a realistic *L=2* example at the end of the notes.
