# Deep Learning Notes

## Mathematics for Deep Learning

These [Mathematics for Deep Learning](./mma-notes/MathematicsForDeepLearning.nb.pdf) notes are intended to document &mdash; with easy-to-follow but rigorous steps &mdash; multi-variable calculus as it is commonly applied to backpropagation. The final result for the gradients with respect to the neural net's parameters is surprisingly simple. To be fair, the apparent simplicity depends on some sweet notation. *For clarity, I should probably add a realistic L=2 example at the end of the notes.*
